* It is recommended to add unit tests for any SINK with more than minimal functionality. Please follow TDD.  
* It is recommended to provide an example. This can certainly be within unit tests but can be a separate example also
* All modified functionality must be backed up with unit tests. 
* All new functionality should be backed up with API documentation (API.markdown or README.markdown)
