# New Code: 
1. Please support all changed functionality with unit testing. A TDD approach usually leaves a cleaner end result than writing test afterwards


# Issues: 
1. Please explain your environment in the ticket. Frequently initialization issues due to not following best practices or the documentation are the causes. 
Check the documentation and search previous issues before opening up a new one.  
1. Don't be afraid of adding additional contexst of an old issue in case you think
this will improve things for the community going forward. 


# Community Driven: 
g3log+g3sinks are community driven. Be respectful. Nobody is getting paid and being polite and helpful will get you further than having an attitude.
